# SmartDriver


I want to create a Application that create a place where Logistics companies and drivers can interact with userinter of routes and also have a chat for asking question or real time comments of traffic or alternate routes. The drivers can think of this like a game where the more the get to a destination on time they earn points to become a smarter driver keeping the roads safe. The app can be used as a voice "walkie-talkie" or a blog to post about the things they like to see on the road. Maybe you and another driver like the same stop or the same food, or even share some philosophical ideas or political, why not set a pin to meet up and find a friend in a lonely field.
